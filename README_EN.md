# Minigame in Discord.py

### Prerequisites
run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to download required dependences<br>
if you wanna use the "shutdown" command, the first time you type the command, it'll generate a `Admin.txt` file in `data/` folder with the discord bot.<br>
put your own Discord ID and other trusted person's Discord ID in it to run the command without permission issues.

### Discord Token
The discord token was placed in ".env", named as "DISCORD_TOKEN".<br>
for example:<br>
.env<br>
DISCORD_TOKEN = MY.DISCORD.TOKEN
